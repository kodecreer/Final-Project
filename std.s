;This is the std library for basic helper functions that
;make the program a lot easier to product
;I did implement random numbers, but it was too buggy to 
;include the project
global getchar, print

section .data

section .bss
;the data to hold the character
cin:
    resb 1
;This is dummy bytes to hold extra values in the line to ignore
dummy:

section .text
;To make the program more readable we will add this
;file of Enumerations
%include "io.h"

;parameters: There is none
;return value: 
;al will be the value in a comparable value for characters
;ecx will be the value in a comparable for strings but contains jus the one character
;eax will have the lenght entered but it doesn't matter really since we are writing for just one charcter
